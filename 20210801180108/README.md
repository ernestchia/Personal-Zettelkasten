# The Bible is not a historical account

If you take the Bible literally, at face value only, it seems to be a description of events which happened in the past.  Yes, some of the events it describes did actually occur.  

But do you really believe that a woman was literally created from the rib of a man?  No, such descriptions aren't actual events. They are allegories.  

You can begin to understand the allegories in the Bible by reading the writings of Emmet Fox.
